Visualization of Data Distribution

This repository contains a simple example of how to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. In this example, I have visualized the distribution of [choose either "ages" or "genders"] in a population dataset.

Key Features:
Data Preparation: The dataset used is [describe the dataset briefly, e.g., synthetic, publicly available, etc.].
Categorical Distribution: For categorical data like gender, a bar chart is used to display the frequency of each category.
Continuous Distribution: For continuous data like age, a histogram is employed to show how the values are distributed across different ranges.
Visualization: The charts are created using [mention the library used, e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.], and they provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the data distribution.
Customization: The code includes options for customizing the appearance of the charts, such as colors, labels, and titles.
Usage:
You can use this script as a starting point to visualize the distribution of any categorical or continuous variable in your own datasets. Feel free to modify and adapt the code to suit your specific needs.
